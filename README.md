Our project aims to create a webpage that provides information about top movies from 2002 to 2003. 
Our objective is to answer following questions:
   - What makes movies successful? 
   - Do high budgets or released dates have an effect on its success?
   - What is the most successful genre?
   - Which countries made the most movie? 
   - Whether runtime of the movies have changed over time?
   - Where are movies mostly filmed? 

We started getting data from Kaggle web page: there were 2000 data points after we cleaned the data with python 1647 data point left to use for our analysis
then we switched the data to js file.
We used javascript to create graphs and line charts which is interactive with dropdown menu. We added 3 pages to our website by using css .Our tabs consists of  "Home"; "Comparion" and "About" pages: 
  - Home page includes anlaysis of budget vs income and genre analysis 
  - Comparison page includes country analysis 
  - and About page includes summary of our page with links to imdb pages and videos for the top rated movies
 Our Findings:
 Our analysis showed us that drama is the most successful genre. Followed by Action and Adventure.
 One of the reason drama is the leader is historical. It is the oldest genre with comedy. It provides stories from daily life that people find themselves in the movies which makes the experience enjoyable
The least rated movies are fantasy. It is due to being a new genre. it actually gained interest in early 2000â€™s with lord of the ring and harry pother series
Next we looked at profitability of the genres.The most profitable genre is action by followed by adventure and drama. People do like watching action movies in 
most successful genre is Drama followed by Action and Adventure
